This has been built against Orcas Beta 1.

Everything is still very much a work in progress.

We are in need of additional developers.  If you'd like to help out with the
project please talk to us.

Get started:
1) Install LinqTestDB database to MySQL from create_LinqTestDB.sql
2) Run DbLinq.MySql.Example.exe server user password linqtestdb
3) Report bugs to our google project at http://code.google.com/p/dblinq2007/

You can compile and run MysqlMetal to create a context class which represents
your own database schemas.
