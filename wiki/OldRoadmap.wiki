 * Primary key update

June Release (version 0.18)

Later

 * Discriminator property support for select, insert, update, delete
 * Add custom string property conversion delegate on entity update

 * !CreateDatabase and !DropDatabase implementation
 * Caching of compiled queries (speed optimization)

=== Refactoring ===
==== DbLinq ====
 * Refactor !BulkInsert different implementations
 * Remove unnecessary static classes and members

==== DbMetal ====
 * --(Factorize code (there is still to much copy/paste from one implementation to another) )--
