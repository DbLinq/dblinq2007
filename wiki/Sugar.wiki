= Sugar =

"Sugar" is the codename for the new linq to sql generation engine.
Its main goals are:
 * Simplify process (unify joins and projections)
 * Allow extensibility
 * Allow caching

=== Process ===

The main process is:
 I. Parse Expressions (Sugar only)
  1. Expressions language patterns identification and replacement (VB string compare for example)
  * Expressions dispatch
    * Non-operation expressions deduction
     * Table
     * Column
     * Input parameter
     * Meta-table (a class containing table aliases)
    * Key methods (where, select...) identification and inner expressions dispatching (top-level method is handled specifically)
  * Constants reduction
 * Generate SQL (Sugar + Database IVendor)

=== The cache ===

The cache keeps track of:
 * Generated SQL
 * Result value/type(code generation expression)
 * Parameters
The cache key is the linq expression reference (to be checked)
