= Development guidelines =
=== Conception recommendations ===
==== Use dependencies injection (and allow extensions) ====
 * Components implement an interface (such as `DataMapper` and `IDataMapper`). User classes use interface (the default implementation is injected in the constructor)
 * Avoid `static` classes and members, since they don't allow interface implementation

=== Naming ===
 * We start from .NET naming conventions at [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xzf533w0(vs.71).aspx]
 * Use !PascalCase for classes, methods and public/protected properties names
 * Use camelCase for parameters, local variables and private properties
 * Use long (explicit) variable names, and no short names (`Generated` instead of `Gen`, `Variables` instead of `Vars`, etc.)
